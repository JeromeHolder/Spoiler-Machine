# Spoiler-Machine
OVERVIEW
A node-based app that takes in and validates CLAs (a movie title and a time limit) and uses asynchronous functionality, web scraping and the TMDB API to print news about the movie entered and the plot of that movie after the time limit.

MAIN FEATURES
The CLAs can be entered in any order, and a warning will be printed if there are too many or too few arguments entered.

TECHNOLOGIES
Cheerio and request are used to scrape the google news feed and hit the TMDB API.
